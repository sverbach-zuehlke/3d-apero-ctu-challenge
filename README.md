# 3D apéro challenge
_POV: It's you, the one and only Markus, and you need to prepare the next apéro which is already taking place tomorrow.
Forward-thinking as you are, you have already prepared a five-star menu last week.
Stressed as you are, you just can't figure out where you've left that menu. 
The kitchen staff is already giving you side-eyes..._

_You remember that the menu must be somewhere at this one weird table, time to check it out again..._
_You just need to find it and quickly prepare the meal so the staff can deliver yet another fantastic apéro experience._

# Setup

## Prerequisites
_You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine to solve this challenge._

## Running the app
First you'll need to install dependencies:
```
    npm install
```

Then you can start the app with:
```
    npm start
```

Great, now it should run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
It should also hot-reload on every save.

## Instruction
This app uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) which is a JavaScript 3D library.
Have a look at their [examples section](https://threejs.org/examples) if you're interested in learning more 
(not required for this challenge, everything you'll need is already in here).

To load and manipulate objects, have a look at `loadObjects.js`, there are useful helper methods at the bottom of that file (wink).
To load and manipulate scene, have a look at `initScene.js` (I don't know why you'd want to do that tbh).
It all comes together in the `<script>` section of the `index.html` file.

# Submission
Send a screenshot of the finished meal to the instructor via teams or however. 
You might win a price if you're first ;)

A meal is finished, when
- the main course is placed on the big plate
- the dessert is placed on the smaller plate
